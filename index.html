      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization run by an all-volunteer board of directors. 
        Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, 
        educate, and entertain our audience! As one of our members said: 
        "Every year I give a ticket package to each of my family members — I think of it as the gift of knowledge, and that is priceless."
